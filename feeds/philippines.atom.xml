My unofficial estimate is that we had about 90% of the attendees from the first day attend (with the unfortunate exception of most of the faculty and students of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.13hq.com/"&gt;Agoo Computer College&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day started with...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lightning-talks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lightning Talks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I don't normally take notes on lightning talks. I'm kicking myself now. &lt;strong&gt;Really hard.&lt;/strong&gt; I'll try and relate some of the talks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import this and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/that"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; a parody talk by Daniel Greenfeld (me). &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt/status/219244338029412352"&gt;Malcolm comment on it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting into space using weather balloons by Frank Pohlmann&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/audreyr/ponystrap"&gt;Ponystrap&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey Roy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://klewel.com/conferences/djangocon-2012/index.php?talkID=31"&gt;video from DjangoCon Europe&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagalog"&gt;Tagalog&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_languages"&gt;Philippine languages&lt;/a&gt; translation of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://djangoproject.com"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; by Malcolm Tredinnick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The obligatory PyCon lighting talk on Vim by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/bry_bibat"&gt;Bryan Bibat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://openerp.com/"&gt;OpenERP&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/PliniusSecundus"&gt;Frank&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.auberonsolutions.com/"&gt;Pohlmann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ann-tan-pohlmann/4/a30/233"&gt;Ann Tan-Pohlmann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A parody talk by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mrvaldez"&gt;Sony Valdez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was on to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sprints-and-tutorials"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sprints and Tutorials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouraged at #pyconph seeing so many people declaring themselves beginners and then diving in. Enthusiasm was a bit contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt"&gt;Malcolm Tredinnick&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt/status/219425413301157889"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary funding for the sprints came from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation"&gt;Django Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pythonsprints.com/"&gt;Python Sprints&lt;/a&gt;. That funding went towards food, drinks, and various logistics for handling the estimated 200+ attendee turnout.  Things sprinted on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id1"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Django&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django had it's own dedicated and very full room (no more chairs could fit so I sat on the floor), with Malcolm Tredinnick leading the effort, with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://marconijr.com/"&gt;Marconi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/marconimjr"&gt;Moreto&lt;/a&gt; helping out. It turned into mostly an effort to get a lot of people kick-started in Django. What was very heartening was watching people race through the tutorials on their own, and then work on projects using the framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect next year the sprints will see a lot of submissions to Django core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had hoped to continue my work on Class Based View documentation, but it was wisely pointed out that I should focus more on helping others get moving in Django and other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ansible"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ansible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://capsunlock.net"&gt;Rodney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cocoy"&gt;Quillo&lt;/a&gt; led the sprint on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ansible.github.com/"&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt; tool of which he is so fond. About seven people fond of engineering joined him. They seemed very productive and happy by day's end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pymongo"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;pymongo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of developers working on embedded devices gathered to work out an edge case issue with pymongo. I wish I knew more about their efforts, but I can tell you that this sort of very serious engineering effort is very common amongst professional Filipino developers. Because of geography, telecommunications and embedded devices are much more prevalent in the island nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-efforts"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other efforts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I'm kicking myself. There were a ton of other development going on and I didn't document any of it. Certainly I was busy here and there helping out, but this is the sort of thing you need to document at the moment. Next time I assure you I will be very diligent about recording the efforts of so many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tutorial-room"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tutorial Room&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half the people stayed in what I dubbed the tutorial room. This is where speakers took turns going over material we had brought to the conference. Attendees followed along, and the diligence and focus in the room was very impressive. The tutorials/talks included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intro to Python using Turtle by Sony Valdez&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to git and github by Bryan Bibat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/python-worst-practices"&gt;21 Cool Things You Can Do With Python&lt;/a&gt; by Daniel Greenfeld (me)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="food-and-drinks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food and drinks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean to mention that the breakfast, lunch, and snacks at PyCon Philippines 2012 were pretty good. The logistic chairs had decided rather than gamble on the usual sort of over-priced and not-so-good professional catering service that most conferences rely on to the dismay of... well... everyone, to go with local restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner people went out on their own. We were lucky enough to go to Pino in Quezon City both times. The Kare-Kareng Bagnet was really tasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conference-end"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conference End&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference chair, Frank Pohlmann, gave us a few well spoken words about how wonderful the event was to run and host. How gratifying it was to see the enthusiasm and dedication of the attendees, and how inspired he felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we cheered him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that it was a lot of pictures and goodbyes to many new friends. Which meant a lot of sad feelings about a great event coming to an end. I felt inspired and changed. I wasn't the same person going in as I was coming out. I'm more grateful for what I have, and deeply honored that I had this chance to bring PyCon to so many wonderful people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More thoughts on PyCon Philippines in a forthcoming blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="coming-soon"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coming soon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Story of PyCon Philippines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can assure you that PyCon PH was an wonderful, amazing, humbling experience. I'm hoping that this post and others will get across to you why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="arrival"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arrival&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Pohlmann, chairman of PyCon Philippines picked us up and drove us to the event. He had worked day and night getting the event ready, all the while running his company, working a job, and being a father to his lovely 21 month old daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we arrived at the venue, Audrey and I were met by our good friend, Filipino-American Bryan Veloso of Github, who was to provide the closing keynote. As soon as Bryan heard that there was going to be a PyCon in the Philippines he gave up his trip to Europython to be a speaker at PyCon PH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, we were greeted Ann Tan-Pohlman, logistics co-chair and volunteer organizer. She had over a dozen volunteers getting ready for the oncoming flood of registrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on the herculean efforts of the organizers and volunteers of this event in a forthcoming blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="inspiration"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We noticed a large group gather by a side corridor and went to say hello. There we met &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mrvaldez"&gt;Sony Valdez&lt;/a&gt;, President of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.13hq.com/"&gt;Agoo Computer College&lt;/a&gt;, and forty of his faculty and students. They were buzzing with energy and excitement, belying the fact that they had left at midnight the night before in order to arrive on time (they traveled many hours by bus). Audrey, Bryan, and I were floored by their effort to educate themselves, and were determined in our speeches not to disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the majority of the Agoo Computer Science had to go in the middle of the afternoon. &lt;strong&gt;We didn't know they had to go until it was time to leave&lt;/strong&gt;. Next year I plan to do whatever is possible to help them come for the duration of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pycon-begins"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyCon Begins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the national anthem, the Dean of Computer Science, Adrian Roy Valdez, started the event with a few words. Frank Pohlmann, PyCon PH chair thanked everyone involved including the sponsors, speakers, and especially the attendees. I gave a keynote speech I'll blog about shortly, and then it was time for the talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="intro-to-python-1"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Intro to Python &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id10" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/titopao"&gt;Paolo Barazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulo gave the Intro to Python talk. He was burdened by some equipment issues, but kept going undeterred. It reminded me of the first time I spoke at PyCon 2010, when for the first 10 minutes of my talk they couldn't get the projector to work. In any case, Paolo did a great job under very trying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-tricks-you-can-t-live-without-2"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Python Tricks you can't live without &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id11" id="id2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey Roy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audrey summarized a lot of the really important things you need to know in Python but aren't part of an introductory talk. Things like pip and virtualenv, how to construct packages, basic use of PyPI, and hammered home the need for good documentation. I may be partial, but I think this was the best version of this kind of talk ever given. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="django-quickstart-3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Django Quickstart &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id12" id="id3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://marconijr.com/"&gt;Marconi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/marconimjr"&gt;Moreto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marconi built off what Audrey provided, and added to it by giving a good introduction to Django. He also contributed a lot during the sprints the next day by pitching in with beginners. His talk featured code for a simple TODO app, and you can see the working example at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://quickstart.marconijr.com/"&gt;http://quickstart.marconijr.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="game-programming-with-python-4"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Game Programming with Python  &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id13" id="id4"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you afraid of math? Too bad! In this tutorial you will learn how to math! Scary, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;&amp;mdash;Sony Valdez&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Valdez, who I mentioned earlier, gave a talk on pygame and math while wearing the Barong Talalog. Not just any talk on pygame, but the best one I've ever seen. He's a natural speaker and educator, and extremely funny. And while giving this amazing talk on no sleep (remember - he was on a bus with 40 of his students and faculty), he broke many classic presenter rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Live code demo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote a functioning game while giving this talk. He made his mistakes part of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Used notepad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right. He didn't use Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, or PyCharm. He used notepad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Someone else's laptop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He used an unfamiliar computer for his talk. Ever try and type on a keyboard you aren't familiar with? This is what he was dealing with while after a 5+ hour bus journey with probably no sleep the night before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm in awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="functional-programming-in-python-5"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Functional Programming in Python  &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id14" id="id5"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt"&gt;Malcolm Tredinnick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony was a hard act to follow, but Malcolm gave an amazing rendition of his classic talk on functional programming. I've seen Malcolm give this talk before, but this instance was clearly the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ansible-6"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ansible &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id15" id="id6"&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://capsunlock.net"&gt;Rodney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cocoy"&gt;Quillo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's a python conference without one talk about system engineering? Fortunately for us, Rodney gave a talk on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ansible.github.com/"&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt;, a pretty new Python based deployment tool. What makes Ansible different is it's range of options, and simplicity of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-didn-t-know-it-s-python-python-advocacy-7"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I didn't know it's Python: Python Advocacy &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id16" id="id7"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;PyCon: More fun in the Philippines&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;&amp;mdash;Variant of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.itsmorefuninthephilippines.com/"&gt;Philippines Department of Tourism slogan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulo Barazon returned to talk about the big users of Python, how to promote it's use, and why it's so awesome for... well.. lots of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="maps-of-imaginary-lands-8"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Maps of Imaginary Lands &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id17" id="id8"&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malcom came back to give us a talk on how to assemble the components necessary to do a mashup of an imaginary place he cooked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="closing-keynote-design-your-open-source-project-9"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closing Keynote: Design your open source project &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id18" id="id9"&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/bryanveloso"&gt;Bryan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://avalonstar.com/"&gt;Veloso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryan closed out the day with an inspirational and funny keynote speech instructing beginners on how to make your project used and loved by developers. His slides were incredible, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/bryan/p/design-your-own-open-source-project"&gt;as you should see for yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

PyCon is a volunteer run effort that brings together Python developers from a variety of backgrounds and skill levels into a friendly, cooperative environment in order to educate, inspire, and work together - building relationships that transcend the event and can turn into lifelong friendships or even very impressive business alliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is possible due to the hard work and contributions of members of the Manila Python users group, the support of the Python Software Foundation, various members of the Python community, our gracious sponsors, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be there, along with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey Roy&lt;/a&gt; and Django core developer &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt"&gt;Malcolm Tredinnick&lt;/a&gt;. Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-is-python"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Python?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; is an open source programming language used for science, engineering, robotics, entertainment, web development, and more. It is used by organizations such as Google, NASA, Instagram, Pinterest, Mozilla, Walt Disney Animation Studios, WETA Digital, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="interested-in-attending"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interested in attending?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then head to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ph.pycon.org/register.html"&gt;registration page&lt;/a&gt;. The early bird discount ends on June 15th, so buy your tickets now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="interested-in-sponsoring"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interested in sponsoring?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please go to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ph.pycon.org/sponsor.html"&gt;sponsorship page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your sponsorship would go a long way towards making PyCon Philippines 2012 a memorable event. As this is an entirely volunteer-run event, 100% of funds go toward actual event costs: food, drinks, chairs, tables, signage, nametags, flyers, advertising, etc. Per custom with PyCons around the world, the organizers receive no payment for their efforts, and any funds left over will be either placed in a Philippine based non-profit corporation or donated back to the Python Software Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
