On May 12th, 2012, over 50 Python_, `C++`_, Ruby_, PHP_, JavaScript_, and `Node.js`_ developers arrived to code on a variety of projects. It was awesome! Tons of open source projects saw contributions, and people across languages and frameworks worked together.

Event Background
================

Less then two weeks before May 12, a bunch of us Los Angeles area Python developers were hanging out and wishing we had a local sprint to attend that was just about developers working on open source projects. It was then that `Audrey Roy`_ and I, along with an army of hardworking volunteers, decided to stop wishing and make it happen on May 12th.

We lined up a venue, contacted awesome sponsors `Spire.io`_, Heroku_, Github_, `Cars.com`_, and `Cartwheel Academy`_. As we did that, we also invited people from the many Los Angeles programming communities in Los Angeles to join us. The result of everyone's hard work? **We filled up all sixty spots in less than 96 hours!**

Some of the projects worked on included:

* Salt Stack: https://github.com/saltstack/salt 
* A node.js-powered streaming terminal, allowing for shared input at a terminal among several participants.
* A JavaScript powered astrolabe.
* Settlers of Catan analytics in JavaScript.
* OpenFrameworks_, a cross-platform toolkit for creative coding in C++.
* My own time at the sprint was spent with Audrey Roy and `Randall Degges`_ on engineering cleanup and fixing bugs on OpenComparison_.


More open source sprinting on July 15

There's going to be another Los Angeles open source event on July 15 at Originate_. Instead of less then two weeks to plan, we have nearly two months - so it's going to be better!
