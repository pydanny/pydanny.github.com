Hi, I'm Daniel Greenfeld. You might know me from this blog_. I'm here to talk to you about a very import subject: **Submitting your talk early to PyCon US.**

.. _blog: http://pydanny.com

Last year there were hundreds of talks were submitted for just a very few speaking slots. **Unpaid volunteers** labored for hours before and after their normal jobs reviewing and debating which talks were to get in. The volume of talks combined with simple reviewer fatigue means that earlier submitted talks got more attention. 

Please don't leave your poor talk or tutorial out in the cold.

**Submit early.**

Help us fix the problem in one of two ways:

#. `Submit your talk as early as possible`_.
#. `Help review PyCon US talks`_.

Production notes for this service message
=========================================

I've always wanted to do one of those TV public service messages done by B or C grade actors. As a D-grade blogger I thought I might be a pretty good match for the role. :-)
