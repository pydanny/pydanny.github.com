My PyCon 2012 Schedule
====================================

Here I was thinking that this year's PyCon wasn't going to be so busy because I didn't submit a talk or tutorial. Ha! What the heck was I thinking?

Here's what I've already got in the works.

Wednesday, March 8th
====================

Me and Audrey are driving up from Los Angeles. I've wanted to do this drive for a while, so this is very exciting. We'll arrive in the evening and hopefully tag up with friends old and new.

Thursday, March 8th
====================

I'm moderating the Code Reuse panel of the Python Web Summit. `Have you submitted a question yet`_?

In the evening we'll be helping assemble bags for the conference. That's always a blast.

Friday, March 9th
====================

PyCon really begins! I'll be at the keynotes, and then the talks begin. These are some of the talks I'm really leaning towards watching:

* `Introduction to Metaclasses`_
* `The Art of Subclassing`_
* `Data, Design, Meaning`_
* `Code Generation in Python: Dismantling Jinja`_

The problem, of course, is that all the talks look awesome. Missing some of these talks is going to hurt.

In the evening we're going to the New Relic/Loggly/Skull Candy party and hang out at the (in)famous TIP BOF.

Saturday, March 10th
====================

I'll be at the `Consumer Notebook`_ `Startup Row`_ booth all day! Come and hang out with us and all the other bright, new companies. 

In the evening I'm hosting the `PyCon Capoeira Open Space`_. We've got a seriously large room assigned for the event, and over twenty five people currently signed up to participate (`there's still room for signups`_). Even if you don't want to play a musical instrument or learn/play at Capoeira, come anyway to watch. Some of the players there have some seriously amazing skills - I can assure you've seen them in the movies.

Sunday, March 11th
====================

More talks! 

* Transifex_
* `Sketching a better product`_
* `Building A Python-Based Search Engine`_
* `Diversity in practice`_
 

Monday March 12 - Thursday, March 15
====================================

Sprints! Nothing set in stone yet, but some ideas I've had include:

* Launch python.opencomparison.org for all of Python.
* OpenComparison integration of PyPI OpenID, SourceForge OAUTH, and BitBucket OAUTH.
* Improved OpenComparison integration of the Launchpad API.
* Implement Gitorious API for OpenComparison.
* Implement Text Based search for OpenComparison.
* Hack on Mongo related technologies such as django-mongonaut and some other planned projects.
