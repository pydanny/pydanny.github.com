You should go to `DjangoCon Europe`_ in lovely Zurich_, Switzerland_. Here are 10 reasons why:

1. **Chocolate**
=================
So much of what we like about chocolate comes from Switzerland. For example, Milk Chocolate was invented in Switzerland. 

2. **Keynote speaker: Jacob Kaplan-Moss**
===================================================

Always a great speaker and fun to be around, he's one of the BDFL's of Django_. 



3. **Cheese**
=================

I grew up thinking that Swiss Cheese was just about holes. It's so much more. I can't wait to try fresh European cheese made by master craftsmen from the freshest ingredients.



4. **Keynote speaker: Jessica McKellar**
===================================================

In a word, Jessica is **incredible**. She's a Twisted core developer, PSF board member, part of the trio responsible for the gigantic Boston Python User Group's massive size explosion, and a talented speaker. She's used her incredible talents and skills to increase diversity in the community and generally help other people. 

5. **Breakfast**
=================

Muesli was invented in Switzerland. I love Muesli. I was floored by how much better it was in New Zealand. I can't wait to try it in it's homeland.

6. **Web Site**
=================
The DjangoCon Europe site is crazy. I mean, look at all those animations!

7. **Talks**
=================
This is a single track event with proven speakers like Zachary Voase and Andrew Godwin, yet balances that with bringing in new blood to spice things up. And dare I say `I'm giving a technical talk`_ with `Audrey Roy`_? ;-)

8. **Mountains**
=================
With all the incredible food, you would think you would gain umpteen kilograms. Fortunately there are mountains all around to climb and hike.

9. **Sprints**
=================
Want to sprint on Django itself? Look no further because there will be Django core developers around! There will also be notable Python_ developers like `Kenneth Reitz`_ and others around working hard on a lot of different projects. It's going to intense and fun!

10. **Castles**
=================

Living in the USA, we just don't have anything like castles. DjangoCon Europe will be near a `small horde of stone fortifications`_. Which means if the Zombie Apocalypse happens during the conference, we'll have many secure places to go. They also make lovely tourist destinations. :-)

What are you waiting for?
==========================

DjangoCon Europe has a cap on attendance. Tickets for Python events have been selling out, not just for PyCon US. Don't miss out!

It's all about me
==================

Yup. 

Call me selfish but I want you there because I haven't haven't met all our European friends yet in person. Hope to see you next month in Zurich!
