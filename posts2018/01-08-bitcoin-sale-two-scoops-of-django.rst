Like the title of this blog post says, for Bitcoin purchases we're offering a 25% discount for purchases of `Two Scoops of Django`_. That puts the ebook version at $34.36 and the autographed hardcopy at $38.36. Pretty awesome, right?  If you want to take advantage of this awesome deal, the Bitcoin discount is applied during checkout.

Combining the Bitcoin Discount With the Bulk Discount
======================================================

Yes, the Bitcoin discount can be combined with `bulk orders`_. So if you order 15 books or more, you get both the 20% bulk discount and the 25% bitcoin discount. That means each book is bought at $28.77 versus $47.95! Furthermore, bulk orders are shipped free to anywhere in the world. This makes it an incredible deal for companies, organizations, and user groups.

Stay tuned!
