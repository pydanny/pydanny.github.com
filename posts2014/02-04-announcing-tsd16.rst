We (Audrey Roy and I) just released the **revised**, **expanded**, and **slightly renamed** second edition of our book on Django. It's called `Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.6`_, and you can buy it right now in print format on our `online store`_ or `Amazon.com`_.

Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.6 is chock-full of even more material that will help you with your Django projects. We'll introduce you to various tips, tricks, patterns, code snippets, and techniques that we've picked up over the years. We have put thousands of hours into writing and revising its hundreds of pages of concise, example-packed text.

Why Should You Purchase the Second Edition?
============================================

.. epigraph::

    "I read the first edition cover to cover. The second one raises the bar again. It's pedagogical, entertaining, and thoughtful."
    
    -- Aymeric Augustin, Django Core Developer, Two Scoops of Django 1.6 Reviewer

Why should you buy this updated version of our previous book? Well, it's more than a slight rename, it's been revised_ and expanded_!

It's Revised
============

Significant portions of the previous material have been revised, incorporating huge amounts of feedback submitted by our readers over the past year. We listened to suggestions, clarified existing content, and incorporated useful tips into the book, carefully curating what went in and what didn't. Our goal was to make the existing content even more succinct and worth reading.

.. epigraph::

    "I disagree with the idea that running tests on SQLite is OK, for the same reasons developing on SQLite causes problems."

    -- Aymeric Augustin, Django Core Developer, Two Scoops of Django 1.6 Reviewer

As with writing the previous edition, we asked numerous subject matter experts on security, databases, deployment and more for their feedback and advice. We're not afraid to ask questions or to ask the best and brightest to find fault with our work. It's hard to be told you're wrong by those who you respect, and even harder to change patterns you promoted. However, we believe it's our duty to the readers to make our book the best is can be.

It's Expanded
==============

.. epigraph::

    "Can Two Scoops of Django expand the deployment chapter?"
    
    -- Most frequently-asked request

We had countless requests for more content from readers around the world. People asked us to cover more and more stuff and we've done our best to comply. We have new material on function-based views, Django 1.6-era transactions, deployment, internationalization, Python 3, identical environments, and more.

In fact...

We expanded the book so much that **3 > 4**:

This isn't to say that we padded the book. Not at all. The new material is packed with our loud volume of code examples and concise explanations. We would like to think it's awesome, but that's because we had the whole world helping us put it together.

We Did It Together
==================

I believe this new edition is amazing. As I said before, we didn't do it alone, we had you in our corner. By you, I mean the technical reviewers and readers giving us support and feedback. We did it for you, the Python and Django developers around the world. 

Which means I'm delighted that our latest effort is finally in print. In my perfect world it gets a thousand five star reviews. ;-)
