<h3>2:35 PM talks</h3>
<p>This is a rough spot because there are four really beginner good talks by four great speakers happening at the same time. Since all of this are going to be wonderful presentations, I'm labeling them all as 'must-see'.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/141/">Who are we? A sociological analysis of the indigenous Python tribe</a> (Jackie Kazil) - Journalist and computer scientist at the Library of Congress, Jackie Kazil uses her amazing skills to analyze the Python community's code bases across thousands of projects to determine where we've been as a people and we are going in the future.

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id5">
<h3>3:15 PM talks</h3>
<p>There isn't a beginner-focused talk in this slot, so I'm going to make this the <em>roller-coaster</em> slot. In other words, I'm going to steer you to the most intensely advanced talk at this time. Attend, buckle in the safety harness, and drink in the extreme knowledge!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/80/">Making Apache suck less for hosting Python web applications</a> (Graham Dumpleton) - It is not hard to find developers who will tell you that Apache sucks for running Python web applications.

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="talk">
<h3>4:15 talk</h3>
<p>For this time period there is a single talk specifically aimed at beginners. There are some other useful talks around this time, but they are aimed at educators and integrators over beginners.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/74/">Crypto 101</a> (Laurens Van Houtven) - Cryptography is a tricky subject, and the goal of this 4:15 PM talk isn't to turn attendees into cryptography experts.

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pm-talk">
